## General info

This app is called **PROPS**. The idea behind it is to express saying 'thank you!'
in a geeky way.

## Technologies

* Ruby on Rails 4.2
* Ruby 2.3.1
* Postgres
* React with [react_webpack_rails](https://github.com/netguru/react_webpack_rails)

## Setup

```
bin/setup
```

Create slack application by going to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps).
It is important to set the redirect url for your application to be like `https://yourdomain/auth/slack/callback`.
You'll also need to select Permission Scopes to be as follows:

- identity.avatar
- identity.basic
- identity.email
- identity.team
- chat:write:bot
- team:read
- users.profile:read
- users:read
- users:read.email


Development endpoints:

- http://props.dev
- http://props.dev/auth/slack/callback

When you have the credentials, you need to set up the proper variables in the .env file under `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` and `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` values.

Slack feature:

In order to post kudos notifications and recieve thumbs-ups, you need to set slack channel for your organisation in Settings after signing in. If not set, default Slack channel is `general`.

After creating the slash command, you will be provided with the verification token by Slack. In order to verify that requests are actually coming from Slack add the token to the database. In the console run:
```
EasyTokens::Token.create(value: 'VERIFICATION_TOKEN', description: 'Slack command verification token')
```

Install node dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

Generate react-bundle for the first time:

```
$ npm build
```

  ```
  $ npm start
